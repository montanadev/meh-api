##### These are all the mad pipe dreams of a very few.  None of this exists yet. 
## 💡 LEDApp - The Light Show
This is an ESP8266 that controls an LED light strip. It's not just any light strip, it's a masterpiece of colors and emotions. Each person is represented by a light, and their red, blue, and green colors tell a story about them. The amount of 🔴red in the light indicates how recently they've visited the hackerspace. The amount of 🔵blue indicates how active they are on social media. The amount of 🟢green indicates how many golf balls they can fit in their mouth and other such hackerspace achievements. The lights will fade as time goes on and must be refreshed by doing stuff. Members will be able to opt-out of the LED, but why would they? It's the coolest thing since sliced bread! And if they do opt-out, they will be shamed for it. **SHAME!**<span style="font-size: 10px;">(not really).</span>
## 💥 DoorApp - The Keeper of the Keys
This is an ESP32-CAM that guards the entrance with the power of technology. It's looking for QR codes that represent membership, and it doesn't take any chances. The QR codes change every 30 seconds based on RSA, and map to a user. If the user is paid in full or only three months late on payments, the door will unlock. Otherwise, it will politely send a message to the phone to encourage the user to meet with a staff member to sort out membership. And if that doesn't work, it will give them a love-tap with a taser.  Well... in spirit. When the user enters, their respective LED will light up with a 🔴RED color, letting everyone know they are welcome.
## 🤖 SocialApp - The Socializer
This is a Slack chatbot that keeps track of how active people are and updates the LEDApp to be more 🔵blue every time members post in a place the chatbot has access to. But it's not just any chatbot, it's a master of communication, a wizard of words, a hero of engagement! Indeed it is so masterful, getting responses from it seems an unnecessary feature. It will encourage people to post more, to share more, to be more involved in the hackerspace community. And the LEDApp will shine brighter and brighter, reflecting the social energy of the space and the raging sun of eternal passion that ... something something. . blah blah. blah... ugh.....
## 🌟 AccoladesApp - The Shining
This is an app that allows staff to bestow accolades to members, brightening their 🟢green light on the LEDApp. Members who go above and beyond, who contribute to the hackerspace in meaningful ways, who help their fellow members, will be recognized and celebrated. The app features a system of awards and badges, each with its own set of criteria. Staff members can nominate members for awards, and the community can vote for the winners. And when a member receives an award, their green light on the LEDApp will shine brighter than ever before, for all to see and appreciate! With AccoladesApp, the hackerspace community is not just a place to work on projects, but also a place to recognize and celebrate the hard work and dedication of its members. Members will feel valued and appreciated, and will be motivated to continue contributing to the community. The app also features a leaderboard, showing the top contributors to the hackerspace, and a history of all the awards and accolades that have been given out. And who knows, maybe one day a member will receive the ultimate accolade, and their name will be immortalized in the hackerspace hall of fame, shining bright on the LEDApp for all time! With AccoladesApp, the hackerspace is not just a community, it's a family, and everyone is valued and appreciated.
## 🔑 OTPApp - The Keeper of the Secret
This app displays a QR code that changes every 30 seconds once the user has provided a login. It receives messages and totally doesn't mine 💰💰💰 crypto. Access is granted only to those who pass the test of 🔐security, and once they do, they become part of a select group of hackerspace enthusiasts. They will be welcomed with open arms, and their name may or may not be rumored to be written in the hackerspace hall of fame!
