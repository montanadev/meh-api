# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability in our code, we kindly request that you keep it to yourself. We've worked
hardly to make sure our code is secure, and we'd hate for all that sporadic work to go to waste just because some hacker
is aware that they're better than us.

That being said, if you absolutely must tell us about a security vulnerability, please send us a detailed email
describing the issue, along with a list of all the passwords you've used in the last 5 years. We promise to get back to
you as soon as we've finished panicking and changing all our passwords.

## Supported Versions

Our security policy only applies to the latest version of our software. If you're using an older version, we suggest you
upgrade to the latest version and hope for the best.

## Reporting a False Positive

If you think you've found a security vulnerability in our code, but it turns out you're just really bad at programming,
please don't be embarrassed. It happens to the best of us. Just send us an email with a detailed explanation of what
went wrong, along with a list of all the programming courses you've taken in the last 5 years. We promise not to laugh (
too hard).

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about our security policy, or just want to chat about how we're going to survive the
inevitable robot uprising, please send us an email at roundfile@meh.ninja. We'd love to hear from you (but preferably in
remote code execution that involves gifs and beep music).
